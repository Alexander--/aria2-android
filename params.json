{"name":"aria2 for Android","tagline":"aria2 port for Android devices","body":"### Using this app\r\n\r\nThis app does not prevent device from sleeping! During device sleep all downloads are greatly slowed and will most likely timeout. To prevent this for now you can use ATE integration and enable \"Take WakeLock\" and \"Take WifiLock\" in ATE menu when downloads are in process. Make sure to disable them afterwards, or you battery will discharge very quickly. A better solution will be provided in future.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use one of advanced features of aria2, you can try to edit it's configuration file (named aria2.txt, stored in the same directory as downloaded files). Consult aria2 manual for additional details on the matter: http://aria2.sourceforge.net/manual/en/html/index.html\r\n\r\n### Reporting bugs\r\n\r\nUse the [project forum](https://sf.net/p/aria2-android/discussion/) to quickly send feedback and report bugs. No registration required, but there may be some spam (don't worry, I will respond to your messages anyway).\r\n\r\nUse the Github bug tracker : https://github.com/Alexander--/aria2-android/issues to report issues directly. You will need a Github account (it's free, you don't have to be developer to register one). All general issues with aria2 (e.g. \"I was banned from the tracker X, because of Y\") should be reported to aria2 bug tracker instead : https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2/issues.\r\n\r\nYou can contact me directly via mail, as listed on the Google Play page. This is undesirable, but still better, than posting rants in Google Play reviews.\r\n\r\n### How to help\r\n\r\nYou can help to translate this project on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/aria2-android). You will need to register there. It is free, and you will be able to help with translating other open-source projects besides this. After joining the project team you will be able to update existing translation, as well as help to translate this app to other languages.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
