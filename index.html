<a id="using-this-app" class="anchor" href="#using-this-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using this app</h3>

<p>This app does not prevent device from sleeping! During device sleep all downloads are greatly slowed and will most likely timeout. To prevent this for now you can use ATE integration and enable "Take WakeLock" and "Take WifiLock" in ATE menu when downloads are in process. Make sure to disable them afterwards, or you battery will discharge very quickly. A better solution will be provided in future.</p>

<p>If you want to use one of advanced features of aria2, you can try to edit it's configuration file (named aria2.txt, stored in the same directory as downloaded files). Consult aria2 manual for additional details on the matter: <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/manual/en/html/index.html">http://aria2.sourceforge.net/manual/en/html/index.html</a></p>

<h3>
<a id="reporting-bugs" class="anchor" href="#reporting-bugs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting bugs</h3>

<p>Use the <a href="https://sf.net/p/aria2-android/discussion/">project forum</a> to quickly send feedback and report bugs. No registration required, but there may be some spam (don't worry, I will respond to your messages anyway).</p>

<p>Use the Github bug tracker : <a href="https://github.com/Alexander--/aria2-android/issues">https://github.com/Alexander--/aria2-android/issues</a> to report issues directly. You will need a Github account (it's free, you don't have to be developer to register one). All general issues with aria2 (e.g. "I was banned from the tracker X, because of Y") should be reported to aria2 bug tracker instead : <a href="https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2/issues">https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2/issues</a>.</p>

<p>You can contact me directly via mail, as listed on the Google Play page. This is undesirable, but still better, than posting rants in Google Play reviews.</p>

<a id="how-to-help" class="anchor" href="#how-to-help" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to help</h3>
