Android port of aria2
==========
This repository contains source code, required to build Android port of aria2 (x86 and armeabi
architectures, both PIC and non-PIC). The port includes frontend application and Android Service,
written in Java, as well as binaries of aria2, cross-compiled for above-listed architectures.
For details of how those binaries are launched by the Android application see manual of
[RootCommands][1] (no root access is needed).

Wait, what?
==========
[aria2][2] is a powerful [CLI][3] BitTorrent client, with support for HTTP/HTTPS, FTP and
Metalink (not available here) protocols. This port provides user-friendly way to launch aria2
daemon from easily installable Android application. It does not include any means to control
the client, add/stop/remove/pause torrent downloads etc. - install one of following frontends
to do that:

Rationale
==========
Upstream aria2 developer provides [aria2 binaries][4] for ARM architecture, but those don't come
handy, unless you are ready to manually launch commands in terminal. There is also no way to
get PIC/non-PIC versions and x86 versions of aria2. But, most importantly, the Linux console app
lacks integration with Android system; no notifications, no sane defaults, no way to start/stop
the process in one click. This project attempts to fix those issues.

Current state
==========
This port is generally usable, but some convenient features (such as ability to change default
aria2 arguments) are missing. Stay tuned with development!

TODO
==========
- [ ] Communicate with daemon over RPC to provide some services on-fly.
- [ ] Async DNS resolution is disabled (see [upstream notes][5]), and there does not seem to be an
easy way to fix it in launcher besides using RPC to supply values during each network change
(see above).

FAQ
==========

* Why does my Lollipop (aka Android 5.0) firmware prints a message about security issues
every time when aria2 is launched?

This is a harmless and expected behavior, the solution is currently [being searched for](#1).

This message is caused by specifics of x86 platform and implies, that _possible_ bugs in
aria2 are slightly more likely be exploited by potential hackers. Fortunately aria2 is rather
secure and constantly maintained application â€“ it is much, MUCH less likely to be exploited,
compared to your (likely already outdated and vulnerable) device firmware.
